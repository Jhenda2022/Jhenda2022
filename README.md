- 👋 Hi, I’m Jhens. I'm a junior software engineer.

My preferred shows are fantasy shows like The Sandman, Moon Knight, and Daredevil, comedy shows like Brooklyn Nine Nine and The IT Crowd, and some detective-esque shows like Sherlock and Prison Break.
- 🌱 I have twelve years of banking and finance experience proficient in marketing, research, financial analysis and financial projected prior to pivoting into junior software engineering roles since 2023. I have handled creation of Python scripts for data extraction utilizing Beautiful Soup, Requests, and Selenium tools in a professional seeting. I have created web apps with HTML, CSS, JS, & Bootstrap commissioned by master degree students.

I have created several personal projects in FE Development (static websites), game and app development with Python (GUI programming, Tkinter),  BE development (Flask, RESTful API), and data visualization (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, plotly, seaborn, google collab, jupyter notebook).
